# what-the-fat

> a website for our favourite fat (except not really bc he eats a million calories a day and is still skinny) dog

This is an updated version of our set of games for our amazing friend Juan's birthday! Matt (me) coded this late in the night with the help of Ellie Cheng, Sharvani Jha, and Evan Zhong as moral support :)

It currently has three Juan-modified games:

* 2048, improved upon from [kubowania's quick-and-dirty 2048 clone](https://github.com/kubowania/2048)
* flappy bird, improved upon from [acm @ ucla's own flappy bird teaching exercise](https://github.com/uclaacm/tla-flappy-bird)
* pong, improved upon from [Gabriel Dube's lovely codepen](https://codepen.io/gdube/pen/JybxxZ)

Prizes are hidden in each game, which requires a private key to properly decode (so even though these gifts are online, they're not usable by people who aren't Juan!)

Happy birthday Juan :)

(p.s., if you want to see last year's website, go to the `2019` branch)
